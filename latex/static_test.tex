%\section{Introduction}

The structural response of the finalized blade design KB5 under the action of a static flapwise force at the blade tip is presented. The analysis is carried out in the time domain aero-servo-elastic tool HAWC2. 
\paragraph{Note on the coordinate system:}
A coordinate system is fixed at the root of the blade with the negative z-axis running from root to tip, the x-axis (blade edgewise) is out of the plane and y-axis (blade flapwise) from right to left. In this coordinate system, the blade root can be considered as being fixed to an imaginary ground with the blade tip pointing skywards. Thus, a twist towards feather would be positive and towards stall would be negative.

A flapwise force of $10$ kN is applied at the blade tip in the positive y-direction. The initial state, final state and resulting deflection for the reference rotor and the KB5 optimized blade is shown in Table \ref{tab:static_load_test}. The unloaded positional values of the tip in the y-direction and x- direction represents the prebend and the sweep respectively. While the unloaded twist value represents the pre-twist of the blade section at the tip. The KB5 blade is seen to deflect more than the reference blade both in the flapwise as well as the edgewise directions owing to a reduction in the stiffnesses, as shown in Section \ref{sec:final_design}. The torsional deflection in KB5 is also much higher than in the reference blade with the blade twisting towards feather. The high deflection is attributed to the combined effect of reduced torsional deflection compared to the reference, and the presence of bend-twist coupling towards feather due to the backward sweep.
