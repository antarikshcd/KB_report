	abstract = {A design tool for performing aeroelastic stability analysis of wind turbines is presented in this paper. The method behind this tool is described in a general form, as independent of the particular aeroelastic modelling as possible. Here, the structure is modelled by a Finite beam Element Method, and the aerodynamic loads are modelled by the Blade Element Momentum method coupled with a Beddoes-Leishman type dynamic stall model in a state-space formulation. The linearization of the equations of motion is performed about a steady-state equilibrium, where the deterministic forcing of the turbine is neglected. To eliminate the periodic coefficients and avoid using the Floquet Theory, the multi-blade transformation is utilized. From the corresponding eigenvalue problem, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed at any operation condition to give the aeroelastic modal properties: Natural frequencies, damping and mode shapes. An example shows a good agreement between predicted and measured aeroelastic damping of a stall-regulated 600 {kW} turbine. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, to assess the load consequences of innovative features and devices added to existing turbine concepts or new turbine concept developed in our research, it is useful to have a full {DLB} that follows the current design standard and is representative of a general {DLB} used by the industry. It will set a standard for the design load evaluations performed at {DTU} Wind Energy, which is aligned with the challenges faced by the industry and therefore ensures that our research continues to have a strong foundation in this interaction. Furthermore, the use of a full {DLB} that follows the current standard can improve and increase the feedback from the research at {DTU} Wind Energy to the international standardization of design load calculations.},

	abstract = {This report contains a description and documentation, including source code, of the basic {DTU} Wind Energy controller applicable for pitch-regulated, variable speed wind turbines. The controller features both partial and full load operation capabilities as well as switching mechanisms ensuring smooth switching between the two modes of operation. The partial and full load controllers are both based on classical proportional-integral control theory as well as additional filters such as an optional drive train damper and a notch filter mitigating the influence of rotor speed dependent variations in the feedback. The controller relies on generator speed as the primary feedback sensor. Additionally, the reference generator power is used as a feedback term to smoothen the switching between partial and full load operation. Optionally, a low-pass filtered wind speed measurement can be used for wind speed dependent minimum blade pitch in partial load operation. The controller uses the collective blade pitch angle and electromagnetic generator torque to control the wind turbine. In full load operation a feedback term from the collective blade pitch angle is used to schedule the gains of the proportional-integral controller to counter the effects of changing dynamics of the wind turbine for different wind speeds. Blade pitch servo and generator models are not included in this controller and should be modeled separately, if they are to be included in the simulations.},
